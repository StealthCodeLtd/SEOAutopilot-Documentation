# Email order

Email order - as the name implies - is the order the software will use from the account template while the campaign is trying to register new accounts. Example: if you have 3 mails, teh software will use those 3 mails one-by-one.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you enable "**Random Email Order**", SEO NEO **will not** take account the order of the emails listed but will use a random email from the template each time needed.
{% endhint %}
