### What is a diagram ?

A diagram has three basic elements: **money site, link groups** and **connections**.

**Link groups** are groups of tasks that your campaign has. Tasks are separated by groups in order to differentiate types of sites.

**Connections** are lines within a diagram that connect link groups with money site or with other link groups.

**Money site** is the list of URLs your campaign is targeting.

When you **connect a link group with your money site**, this means that your money site URLs will take backlinks from these groups.

When you **connect a link group with another link group**, you create a flow between these groups. This means that after the first link group finishes, it gives all submitted URLs (created from posts etc.) to the other link group.

Creating a "_more complex_" makes your campaign seem more "natural". Its better for your link profile to have more than 1 tiers.
