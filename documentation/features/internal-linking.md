## What is Internal Linking?

Internal links are hyperlinks that connect one page on a website to another page within the same domain.

Internal links help users navigate a website, guiding them from one page to another. This improves website structure and hierarchy by linking related content. Good internal linking can encourage visitors to spend more time on a site by exploring other pages.&#x20;

But what about SEO value of internal links?

## Why Internal Links are Important for SEO?

Internal links are crucial in SEO for several reasons:

#### Indexing of Web Pages

Internal links assist search engines in indexing your site. When search engines crawl a site, they follow links to find and index pages. A well-linked site is easier to crawl and gets its pages indexed more quickly.

#### Content Value and Context

By linking to related content, you can provide additional context and value to your users. This can also signal to search engines what the page is about, aiding in more accurate and relevant indexing.

#### Page Authority and Ranking

Search engines use links to discover new content and to help determine the value of a page. Internal links pass 'link equity' or 'link juice' between pages. Pages with more internal links pointing to them are often seen as more important and can rank higher in search engine results.
