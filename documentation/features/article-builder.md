Article categories gives the user the flexibility to add niche-relevant content on their buckets according to his campaign needs.

**SEO advice**: it is highly recommended to keep your campaign content niche-relevant for better SEO results. If for example your target website (money site) is a webpage about "car rentals" and your keywords for example are "car rentals", then your content must be relevant (articles and content about cars).

You can even select the number of words (Word Count) to generate articles within a specific word count range (available options: **500**, **750**, **1000** words).
