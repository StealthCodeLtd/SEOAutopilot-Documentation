This quality of life update can save you hours, especially with huge and complex campaigns where you have to create and assign account buckets to each link group.

Some times this may be an issue because you need to create them before creating your campaigns. Even if you have pre-calculated the number of account buckets before creating your campaign, it is time consuming to assign them one-by-one to each group (especially on huge campaigns with dozens or link groups).

With this feature SEO Neo can **generate automatically** and assign account buckets for all your campaign's link groups.

## How to Use

To use this feature, click on "**Generate Account Buckets**" button located on Groups step inside campaign creation.

A new pop-up window will appear with different options for generating your new account buckets.

The first group of options is about account bucket name generation. You can give a **prefix** on generated names, or can can even enable "**Include group type**" and "**Include tier**" to also include group type and tier level (number) on generated account bucket names.

The second group of options is about account buckets folder. You can either let SEO Neo to generate a new folder for your new buckets, or choose a specific folder (**Generate Folder**) where you want new presets to be stored (**Select Existing Folder**).

* **Name prefix:** "demo"
* **Include group type:** disabled
* **Include tier:** disabled
* **Folder option:** Generate Folder

SEO Neo generated **six (6)** account buckets. The reason being, is selected diagram. SEO Neo analyzes selected diagram and generates accounts buckets accordingly.

Another thing to notice here, is that SEO Neo, generated a new folder to keep all new account buckets inside. Generated folder name format is:\
