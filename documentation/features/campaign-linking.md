# Campaign Linking

**Campaign linking** is a feature that allows you to automate cam them to start when another another campaign finishes. This advance scheduling mechanism, helps you speed up your process of automating multiple campaigns and create long drip-feed strategies.

## Understanding Campaign Linking - Terms

In the image below we see a basic campaign linking example, to explain some terms.





* When there are multiple campaign linked together, the whole link schematic is called **"link chain"**.
* When two campaigns are linked together, the top-tier campaign is called **"parent"** and the lower-tier is called a **"child"**. In the image above, campaign **A** is the **parent** of campaign **B** and campaign **B** is the parent of campaign **C**.
* The first campaign in the chain is called **"root parent"**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each campaign in the chain **can only be linked with one parent** and **one child**.  A campaign **cannot have** multiple parents or multiple children.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Understanding Campaign Linking - Flow

Each campaign can be linked with another campaign

In this example campaign A is linked with campaign B and campaign B is linked with campaign C.

Campaign A is called "root parent" as it is the master parent of the whole link chain.
