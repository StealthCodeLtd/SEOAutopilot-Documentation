# Cloud Blogs Settings

To use Cloud Blogs you will need first to setup each cloud blog service credentials.

To do so, navigate:

**Settings** > **Cloud API Settings** tab

From this menu you can setup each Cloud API service separately. For each service you need to give a friendly name (which is used just as an identifier) and credentials to connect to the service.

Each service has different credentials. For example on the image below we can see that Amazon requires: **Key** and **Secret key**, but Azure requires only **Connection string**.

In order to learn how to obtain required credentials, you can read some quick guides for each cloud service on the next pages.

### Multiple API Settings

You can save multiple credential settings for each cloud service. You can manage each setting separately using the edit and delete buttons from the list.&#x20;
