### Using Cloud Blogs Generator

### Blog Information

The first required blog information is **Blog Name** and **Language**.

**Blog Name**: is the name for the user to identify the blog but also the title of the blog.

**Language**: Currently it is only used to set the language for html code. It's only there for search engine crawlers. In the near future SEO Neo will also support translating the blog.
