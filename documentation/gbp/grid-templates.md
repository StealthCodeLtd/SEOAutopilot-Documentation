# Grid Templates

### What is a Grid Template?

Grid templates are designed to store information about a GBP grid. Using grid templates can save a significant amount of time by allowing users to input grid information once and reuse it across different heatmaps.

Whenever a user wants to create a heatmap, the following information is needed:

* Grid size
* Distance between points
* Distance unit type (meters, miles)
* Zoom level
* Google domain
* Language

In order to save time, you can set your grid template once and use it across your heatmaps whenever needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Create your grid templates and use them when you create a heatmap to save time.
{% endhint %}

### Creating a Grid Template

To create a grid template, click on **GBP > Grid Templates**

A new window will appear with all grid information that is required. On the left side of the window is all grid grid information and on the right side you can preview the map (based on grid settings).

### Title & Description

Give you grid template a title and a description (these are friendly names and are used by the user to identify different grids).&#x20;

### Grid Size

Grid size defines the size of the heatmap. Selecting  9x9 grid size will create a grid (heatmap) that will include 9x9 points on map. This means that there will be 81 different points on your heatmap when you create it using this grid template.&#x20;

There is also an indication of how many credits are required for each heatmap based on your grid size.

{% hint style="info" %}
Think of grid size as a "resolution" of your grid/heatmap. _A higher value gives a better resolution for your projects but this also costs more credits._
{% endhint %}

To better illustrate grid size, here are some examples of different grid sizes and how they look on a map. The first one has a size of 5x5 and the second one has size 9x9.

## Distance Between Points

This value allows you to change the distance between each points in the grid. By changing this value you can cover larger areas with the same amount of points (defined by previous value "**grid size**").

You can also change the unit of distance between **meters** and **miles**.

Below is an example of different distance sizes using the **same 7x7** grid size. The first one is set to **200 meters**, the second one is set to **1000 meters** and the last one is set to **5 kilometers**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/distance 200_meters.png" alt="" width="552"><figcaption><p>Grid Size: 7x7 - Distance Between Points: 200 meters</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/distance 1000meters.png" alt="" width="548"><figcaption><p>Grid Size: 7x7 - Distance Between Points: 1000 meters</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/distance 5 km.png" alt="" width="547"><figcaption><p>Grid Size: 7x7 - Distance Between Points: 5 km (5000 meters)</p></figcaption></figure>
