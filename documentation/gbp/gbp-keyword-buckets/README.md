# GBP Keyword Buckets

### Keyword Buckets & Keyword Lists

Keyword buckets are similar to other buckets found in SEO Neo, but instead of containing accounts or content, they include **keyword lists**. Each keyword list is a collection of keywords. Keyword lists and keyword buckets are used in GBP to generate heatmaps or create campaigns using Wizards (applicable to GBP wizards).

### Why Buckets and Lists?

**Keyword buckets** are simply containers that can include different **keyword lists**. These buckets simplify the management of various keyword lists. You can create different folders, with each folder containing distinct buckets, and each bucket can hold different lists. This organization makes it easier for users to manage and categorize their keywords based on project, client, niche, or even geographical area.

To better understand the structure, refer to the image below that showcases the tiers and structure.

Although this scheme of buckets and lists may seem confusing at first, it offers great flexibility when it comes to managing keywords for your GBP projects.
