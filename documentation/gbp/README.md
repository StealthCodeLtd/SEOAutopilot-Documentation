**GBP (Google Business Profile)** module is a powerful SEO Neo module that allows you to track rankings for your Google Business Profile using heatmaps. Except from tracking, you can also run campaigns from Wizard using already created projects from GBP.

GBP module has three different sections:

* [**Projects**](projects.md)
* [**GBP Keyword Buckets**](gbp-keyword-buckets/)
* [**Grid Templat**](grid-templates.md)[**es**](grid-templates.md)

In order to create heatmaps with GBP module you need to use Credits. For more information about credits system, please **read this section of the documentation**.
