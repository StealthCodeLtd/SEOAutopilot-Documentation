# Import content

If you already have content on files or in other content buckets, you can use "Import" to fetch content accordingly. There are different options for importing content depending on content type.

For Articles and Bios you can import:

* From file(s)
* From a file directory
* From [**other content bucket**](import-content.md#import-from-other-bucket).

For Bios, Rich Content and Blog Details you can import only from other buckets.

### Import from other bucket

If you choose to import content from other bucket, you will see a form that shows all other buckets. You can select multiple buckets and import content from from them.

Keep in mind that you import only same-type content from other buckets.

Example: when you are in "**Articles**" section, you will import only articles from selected bucket.

{% hint style="info" %}
Content buckets without content inside them, they will not be displayed when you use "**Import from other buckets**".
{% endhint %}

"**Import from other buckets**" form displays information about other buckets and the amount of content it has for each content type. In the example below, we see:

* "**1st bucket**" has: 5 articles, 1 bio and 2 images.
* "**2nd bucket**" has: 8 articles and 1 bio.

### Import\Export Rich Content

Import content also works for rich content. You can import from files, folder or another bucket. Importing rich content from file(s) or a folder for rich content is used to import rich content from a previous SEO Neo export. When you export your rich content in SEO Neo, it will export .txt file extries for each individual rich content entry, so you use exported files to import them back again in SEO Neo.

{% hint style="info" %}
Rich content import (from file(s) or a folder) is used to import rich content from a previous SEO Neo export.
{% endhint %}
