Dashboard is SEO Neo's main screen which includes: basic software **notifications**, **what's new** from latest update and total number of **campaigns, accounts and links** created.

### Notifications

Notifications inform the user about some basic settings required before the creation of any campaign.

Before creating your first campaign you will need to setup:

* At least 1 [**account bucket**](account-buckets/)
* At least 1 [**content bucket**](content-buckets/)
* At least 1 [**Captcha API**](settings/third-party-api.md#captcha)
*

The dashboard will keep you informed with some notification cards for each requirement. You will need to resolve these requirements before creating your first campaign.&#x20;

To resolve each issue, you can click on each notification card "**Setup**".&#x20;
