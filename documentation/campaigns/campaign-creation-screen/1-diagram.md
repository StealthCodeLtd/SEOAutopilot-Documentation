This is where you choose your campaign diagram.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/campaign - diagram.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select a diagram from the list from the list on the left and then click "**Next**" when you want to move on the next section.

{% hint style="info" %}
Based on your diagram (number of groups, type of groups and tiers) the next sections/parts will be effected.\
\
For example a diagram with a single Web 2.0 group will require less user input than a diagram with many groups and tiers.
