If you haven't created any account template you can always select SEO Neo's default template. Keep in mind that a custom account template with own Gmails provides higher success rate than Default account template.

#### **(4-1)** **Link Matching**

With Link Matching, you can match (link) selected URLs with specific keywords. With this feature you can target specific keywords on selected URLs of your campaign. This feature for example could be used on your e-shop, where you could select specific keywords on different URLs (product types).

After clicking the button, a new pop-up will appear where you can select different options to import URLs from previous campaigns. These options act like a filter to help you import only URLs based on your criteria.

The first option is **Select Campaign**, where you set the campaign you want to import URLs from. The next two (**Select Tier**) and (**Select Campaign Groups**) are filters. You can set it to **All,** to import all URLs or you can give specific tiers and link group types you want to import.

For example you can import only Tier 1, Web 2.0 Blogs URLs from selected campaign.
