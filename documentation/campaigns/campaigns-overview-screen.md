### Campaign Status

A campaign can be in different status depending on campaign state. Below we will explain different types of campaign statuses and what each mean.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Idle" %}
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/status - idle.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A new campaign that has been created and saved.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Draft" %}
<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/status - draft.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A new campaign that has been saved before completely finishing all steps.

When you create a campaign, there are some creation steps and some required fields. You can exit/save the campaign before completing everything. This created a "**draft**" campaign. A **draft** campaign is incomplete and need to be fully completed before running it.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Started" %}

When you start a campaign and while the campaign is running, it is in "**started**" status.

A **started** campaign can be **paused**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Paused" %}
