### Campaign Status

A campaign can be in different status depending on campaign state.&#x20;

Campaign status depicts the state of a campaign. A campaign can be created (**idle**) or can be saved incomplete (<mark style="color:orange;">**draft**</mark>). After the campaign creation, a campaign can be started (<mark style="color:blue;">**started**</mark>), and then either paused (<mark style="color:red;">**paused**</mark>) or run until it's finished (<mark style="color:green;">**finished**</mark>).

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that an incomplete/**draft** campaign (a campaign with not all required data set) cannot start/run. You will first need to edit the campaign and complete all steps before running it.
{% endhint %}

On the table below you can find the different campaign statuses/states and what each mean.&#x20;

### Organizing Campaigns Using Folders

Keeping your campaigns inside separate is a good practice. Using folders can help you manage and organize your campaigns based on your websites, clients or projects. For example you can have a folder where you keep all your campaigns for a specific client or website.

To create a new folder click on "**Create Folder**" button located on top left.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/1 - folders.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>"Create Folder" button located on the top left section - from Campaigns screen</p></figcaption></figure>

A new pop-up window will appear to give a name for your folder.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/2 - folders.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Give your campaign folder a name and then click "Create" button</p></figcaption></figure>

Every time you create a new campaign, the campaign will be saved within the folder that has been selected. In the next image for example, you can see that if you create a new campaign it will saved within the folder "**client A**" which is currently selected.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/3 - folder.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Hover buttons appear when you hover (keep move over) a campaign</p></figcaption></figure>

You can also move campaigns into other folders. You can either move a single campaign using hover button "**Move to Folder**".

You can also move multiple campaigns into a folder by selecting multiple campaigns and then using  "**Move to Folder**" option from the burger button (on the top-right).

Below is a clip demonstrating how to create a new folder and moves your campaigns inside.
