# Utilities

A **utility-type wizard**, while similar to a strategy-type, primarily aims to **simplify** redundant and time-consuming SEO Neo operations rather than create complex SEO strategies. For instance, the "**Cloud Content Poster**" utility wizard assists users in posting to their cloud blogs. The user simply selects their cloud blog, inputs the content, adjusts any additional settings, and the wizard automatically generates a custom campaign for this task.
