# Credit System

Credits are used to as a pay-on-demand way to use some SEO Neo features that are server-based. Currently credits are used for running new heatmaps on [**GBP module**](gbp/) but in the near feature it will be used on other features.

### Why the Credit system?

Some new SEO Neo features are **server based**. In order not to effect the price for all users (even for those that don't want to use a server-based feature) we have introduced **credits** system. This gives the flexibility to pay for a feature when you want to use it.

### Available Credits

You can view your available credits on the top section of SEO Neo.&#x20;
