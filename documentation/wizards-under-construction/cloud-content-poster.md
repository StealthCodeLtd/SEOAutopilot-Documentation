## Wizard Tutorial

This Wizard is broken into two steps:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ccp-step1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1\) General Settings

2\) Post Settings

Let's go and set each available option on this wizard.



## 1 - General Settings

### Campaign Folder

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ccp-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this option you select where you want the wizard to store generated campaign. The default option is "**Auto generate**" which generates a new folder automatically.&#x20;

If you want the wizard to store the new campaign into a specific folder you can select "**Select a Folder**" radio button and use the drop-down menu to select a specific folder.

### Name Prefix

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ccp-4.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Name prefix** gives a prefix on generated campaign name to help you identify it later. Name prefix is optional but it is recommended if you want to keep your campaigns better organized.

### Indexer

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ccp-5.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is the same option that you can find also in other SEO Neo sections (for example when you create a new campaign). You can select an indexer to use for your cloud blogs posts.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is **recommended** to use [**Omega Indexer**](https://www.omegaindexer.com/) or [**Colinkri**](https://www.colinkri.com/) if you want better results with indexing your cloud blog posts.&#x20;

If you need more information on how to setup an indexer [**read this section**](../../quick-start/creating-your-1st-campaign/before-creating-your-campaign/basic-settings.md#indexers) of our documentation.
{% endhint %}

### Select Cloud Blog

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ccp-6.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this section you select which cloud blog you want to use to create your posts. You can filter-out your already generated cloud blogs by folder (using the left drop-down menu and selecting a folder).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to create posts on a cloud blog, a cloud blog **must be already uploaded**. For more information on how to generate and upload cloud blogs, [**read this section of the documentation**](../cloud-blogs/cloud-blogs-generator.md).
{% endhint %}

### Cloud Poster Schedule

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/ccp-7.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This option is optional but is very useful. You can check "**Schedule Cloud Poster**" option and select a date and time (by clicking on the box on the right side).

When you finish with General Settings click on "**Next**" button to navigate to the second step of the wizard.&#x20;



## 2 - Post Settings

This step includes all the options to define your posts on your cloud blog (the one you selected on the previous step).
