<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/shw poster 2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1\) General Settings

2\) Post Settings

Let's go and set each available option on this wizard.



## Step 1 - General Settings

### Campaign Folder <a href="#campaign-folder" id="campaign-folder"></a>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/shw poster 3.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this option you select where you want the wizard to store generated campaign. The default option is "**Auto generate**" which generates a new folder automatically.

If you want the wizard to store the new campaign into a specific folder you can select "**Select a Folder**" radio button and use the drop-down menu to select a specific folder.

## Name Prefix

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/shw poster 4.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Name prefix** gives a prefix on generated campaign name to help you identify it later. Name prefix is optional but it is recommended if you want to keep your campaigns better organized.

## Indexer

This is the same option that you can find also in other SEO Neo sections (for example when you create a new campaign). You can select an indexer to use for your Self-Hosted WordPress posts.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is **recommended** to use [**Omega Indexer**](https://www.omegaindexer.com/) or [**Colinkri**](https://www.colinkri.com/) if you want better results with indexing your posts.

If you need more information on how to setup an indexer [**read this section**](https://docs.seoneo.io/quick-start/creating-your-1st-campaign/before-creating-your-campaign/basic-settings#indexers) of our documentation.
{% endhint %}

## Select Self-Hosted WordPress

In this section you select which self-hosted WordPress you want to use to create your posts. You can filter-out your self-hosted WordPress websites by folder (using the left drop-down menu and selecting a folder).

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on how to setup your self-hosted WordPress account into SEO Neo [**read this section**](../self-hosted-wordpress/) of the documentation.
