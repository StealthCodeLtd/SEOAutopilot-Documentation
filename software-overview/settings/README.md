# âš™ Settings

From **Settings** screen you can change all global settings of the software. These are usually settings that don't change regularly from campaign to campaign.

These settings include: how the software submits posts, proxies to use for the campaigns, settings for cloud sites and visual settings.

There are five main sections/tabs inside **Settings**:

* [Submission](submission.md)
* [Proxies](proxies.md)
* [Third party API](third-party-api.md)
* [Cloud API Settings](cloud-api-settings.md)
* [Visual Settings](visual-settings.md)
