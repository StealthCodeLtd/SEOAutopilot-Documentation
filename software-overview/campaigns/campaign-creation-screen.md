This is where you create your campaigns.

Before creating your campaign you should check if you have the basic requirements. You can view our basic tutorial to understand what you need first before creating your first campaign.

**(1)** The **name** of your campaign

**(2)** The basic steps/sections when you create a campaign.

When you create a campaign, there is a lot of information and user input required. This is why, campaign creation is broken into 4 basic steps/sections.

## 1 - Diagram

This is where you choose your campaign diagram.&#x20;

Select a diagram from the list from the list on the left and then click "**Next**" when you want to move on the next section.

{% hint style="info" %}
Based on your diagram (number of groups, type of groups and tiers) the next sections/parts will be effected.\
\
For example a diagram with a single Web 2.0 group will require less user input than a diagram with many groups and tiers.
