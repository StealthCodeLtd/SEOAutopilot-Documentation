On the left side of the screen **(1)** you can select different filter options to show/hide link groups.

On the right side of the screen **(2)** you set each group settings.

### Group Filters

Group filter help you filter group types according to different criteria. This helps the screen to remain "clear" and less overwhelming.

There are three different filter types:

* **Per Tier View** : filters groups according to their tier level (see diagram for details)
* **Per Group Type View**: filters groups according to link group type (see group types)
* **Groups With Validation Errors**: show only groups with errors while the user sets group data.

To better understand each group filters, we will show you the selected diagram used on this example:
