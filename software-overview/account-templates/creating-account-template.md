### Default Account Templates

You can add as many e-mails as you want inside each account template. If you don't want to create a new account template from scratch, you can use "Default" account template. This template has only one e-mail entry which is SEO Neo Email.

Feel free to use this account template, or even edit it by adding your own emails in it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although SEO Neo comes with its own email (that gets updated regularly) it is better to use your own emails to increase success rate.
{% endhint %}
