# Add content

When you create a new content bucket, it's content is empty. In order to fill it with content, you will need to edit the bucket, by clicking "**Edit**" on hover button.

There are three different ways to add content:

**1) Import**

You can import content from file(s) or other content bucket that already includes content.

**2) Generate**

You can generate content using our free built-in builders, or 3rd party APIs.

**3) Add**

You can add content manually.
