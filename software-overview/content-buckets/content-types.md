# Content types

A content bucket can contain a variety of different content types. These content types are used automatically according to each website requirement.

Here are the different content types that can be included inside each content bucket.



{% hint style="info" %}
Although content entry can get many variations from [**spintax format**](../../additional-information/glossary/spintax-format.md), it is recommended to include multiple content entries for each type. This will give the software a bigger variety to choose from when posting on different websites.
{% endhint %}

You can insert content entries inside each content bucket with one of the following methods:

1. [**Add content**](adding-content.md) (manually entering each entry)
2. [**Import content**](import-content.md) (using already existing content from your computer)
3. [**Generate content**](generate-content.md) (using 3rd-party API's - assuming you have [**set their API credentials**](../settings/third-party-api.md))
