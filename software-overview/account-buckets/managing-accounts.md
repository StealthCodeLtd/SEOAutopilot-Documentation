# Managing accounts

### Accounts Screen Overview

On this screen you will find a table that displays all created accounts and some details for each account.

Below is the list of available information for each account.

**Blog Address:** the blog address (URL) that this account is registered on.

**Username:** username of the account.

**Password:** password of the account.

**Email:** email used to register the account.

**Website:** website (domain) that this account is used.

**Active:** if an account is active, it will be used the next time you use the account bucket on your campaigns. If an account is not active, the account will not be used.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you are using an account bucket on a campaign and there is no active account for a website, a new account for this site is created automatically.
{% endhint %}

### Add account

1\) Click "**New Account**" to open account creation window.

{% hint style="info" %}
From "**Website**" you select for which website you want to use account information (**username, password, email**). Each account is linked to one website.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you disable "**Account active**" then the account will not be used on a campaign. This is useful when you want to have several accounts inside an account bucket but you only want to use certain ones on specific situations.
{% endhint %}

### Delete Account

You can hover any account (row from table) from the table and click "**Delete**" or you can select multiple accounts (using check boxes on the left) and delete all selected accounts.
