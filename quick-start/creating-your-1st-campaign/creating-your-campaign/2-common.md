# 2 - Common

This is one of the most important section when creating your campaign.

&#x20;In this section

* you define your targeted URLs (which money site URL links you want the campaign to target),
* you select an account template&#x20;
* you enter keywords (what type and percentage amount for each keyword type)

Let's start first by selecting an Account Template which is required. For this guide we have created our own Account Template named "my first template" which uses our own Gmails.

Account Templates are used to tell SEO Neo which mails the software will use for this campaign, and how user names will be created. [**More info**](../../../documentation/account-templates/) on Account Templates.
{% endhint %}

### Entering Money Site URLs

Let's start by pasting all URLs what we want to target. For this tutorial we will use non existent URLs for an iaginery website that is supposed to sell cars, but feel free to choose your own. In case you have multiple URLs, you must enter one URL per line.

### Setting your Keyword Strategy

Every time you create a campaign you need to set your keyword strategy. Setting your keyword strategy is very important and its based on your targeted URL niche and your link profile.

There are two main sections for setting-up keywords: **Tier 1 Keywords** and **Tier 2+ Keywords**.

Both sections look almost identical (except from some minor differences on available keyword types) and serve the same purpose: **keywords** and **keyword percentage** for each keyword type you want to use for your campaign.

Tier 2+ Keywords section is available for diagrams that have more than one tier of link groups.
