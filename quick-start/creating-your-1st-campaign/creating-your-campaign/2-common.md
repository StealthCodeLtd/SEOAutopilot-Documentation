# 2 - Common

This is one of the most important section when creating your campaign.

&#x20;In this section

* you define your targeted URLs (which money site URL links you want the campaign to target),
* you select an account template&#x20;
* you enter keywords (what type and percentage amount for each keyword type)

Let's start first by selecting an Account Template which is required. For this guide we have created our own Account Template named "my first template" which uses our own Gmails.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/2 - common - account template.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Account Templates are used to tell SEO Neo which mails the software will use for this campaign, and how user names will be created. [**More info**](../../../documentation/account-templates/) on Account Templates.
{% endhint %}

### Entering Money Site URLs

Let's start by pasting all URLs what we want to target. For this tutorial we will use non existent URLs for an imaginary website that is supposed to sell cars, but feel free to choose your own. In case you have multiple URLs, you must enter one URL per line.

### Setting your Keyword Strategy

Every time you create a campaign you need to set your keyword strategy. Setting your keyword strategy is very important and its based on your targeted URL niche and your link profile.

There are two main sections for setting-up keywords: **Tier 1 Keywords** and **Tier 2+ Keywords**.

Both sections look almost identical (except from some minor differences on available keyword types) and serve the same purpose: **keywords** and **keyword percentage** for each keyword type you want to use for your campaign.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tier 2+ Keywords section is available for diagrams that have more than one tier of link groups.
{% endhint %}

For this guide we assume that our main keywords are:

_car sales_\
_car rental_\
_car reviews_

For this tutorial we will use 3 different keyword categories:

* Primary keywords
* Generic keywords
* Partial match keywords

For Primary Keywords we will use our three keywords (car sales, car rental, car reviews). For Generic Keywords we will use the default values from SEO Neo. Finally, Partial match keywords are generated from the software, based on Primary Keywords.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/keyword settings.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>When you enable a keyword category, you must set percentage value.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
For each keyword type you want to use, you need to **enable the keyword category** from the checkbox and set a keyword percentage.\
\
**Keyword percentage** is how much keywords will be used (in % percentage) for each keyword category.
{% endhint %}

For our example tutorial, we will enable: Primary, Generic and Partial match keyword categories. Because our diagram also has Tier2 groups. We will also enable the same categories for Tier 2+.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/toggle keyword categories.JPG" alt=""><figcaption><p>There are different keyword categories for Tier 1 and Tier 2+ link groups</p></figcaption></figure>

### Setting Primary Keywords

We set Primary Keywords.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/primary keywords.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Use one keyword per line</p></figcaption></figure>

### Setting Generic Keywords

For Generic Keyword we can use SEO Neo's default values. To set default values:

Click "**D**" button, located next to Generic Keywords category.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/generate generic keywords.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click on "D" button to get default Generic Keywords values </p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/generate generic keywords 2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>SEO Neo sets default generic keywords</p></figcaption></figure>

### Setting Partial Match Keywords

To generate Partial Match Keywords: &#x20;

Click on "**G**" button.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/generate partial match keywords.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click on "D" button to generate Partial Match Keywords</p></figcaption></figure>

Select preferred for your keywords.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/generate partial match keywords 3.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
SEO Neo generates Partial Match Keywords based on Primary Keywords. **At least one Primary Keyword is required** in order for SEO Neo to automatically generate Partial Match Keywords.
{% endhint %}

### Setting keyword percentage

After setting your keywords, it's time to set keyword percentage. This defines how many keywords (based on total percentage) will be used from each keyword category.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keywords and keyword percentages is a big part of your SEO strategy. Each campaign required different settings according to your SEO campaign strategy.
{% endhint %}

For this example we will set these values for each category:

* **Primary Keywords**: 50%
* **Generic Keywords**: 20%
* **Partial Match Keywords**: 30%

We will set the same values for for Tier 1 and Tier 2+ keyword categories.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/keyword percentage values 2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Total keyword values = 100</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Because keyword percentage values are based on % **the sum of all keyword values** for must be **100**.
{% endhint %}

If the sum of values is **less or more** **than 100**, SEO Neo will raise validation error (red colored text) and will prevent you from moving to the next section.

In the example below, the sum of all keyword values is: 1 + 20 + 30 = 51 so SEO Neo raises validation error message.

### Setting Keyword format

Although we can move to the next section/step we can make some additional adjustments for our keywords. Except from keywords and percentages, we can set keyword format.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/keyword format.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can set how many keyword we want to be in Bold or Italic format. We can set values for each format for Tier 1 and Tier 2+ keyword separately.

In our example we will set **Bold** = 50% and **Italic** 30%. This means that **there is a chance** 50% for keywords to be in Bold format and 30% chance to be in Italic format.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/keyword format 2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are additional / optional settings we can set for our keyword strategy for for now, we will proceed into the next step / section.
