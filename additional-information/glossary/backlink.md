# Backlink

A backlink is when one website links to another with an anchor text. An example of a backlink is any article you find that links to another source or website. You can find examples of website backlinks all over the internet, especially on popular blog sites that link back to relevant content.

When you create and run a campaign on SEO Neo, the result is the creation of different **backlinks** from High Domain Authority websites that the software supports.
