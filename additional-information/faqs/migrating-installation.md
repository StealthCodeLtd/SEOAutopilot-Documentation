# Migrating Installation

To transfer you installation into another machine, you will need to transfer (**copy - paste**) **"seoneo"** folder from the original installation into target installation.

On Windows and Mac OS machines, the folder path is different. You can find the path below for both systems.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows Path" %}
For Windows users the folder location is:

.**.\ Users \ \[username] \ AppData \Roaming \ seoneo**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mac OS Path" %}
For **MAC OS** users the folder location is:

**Users > \[username] > Library > Application Support > seo neo**
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep in mind to **close** SEO Neo **before coping** the folder, otherwise your data may get corrupted.
{% endhint %}
