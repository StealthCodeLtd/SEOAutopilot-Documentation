# Hardware requirements?

In order to run SEO NEO properly, you need to have a VPS or other device with 4 cores, 8GB RAM, and 10GB free hard disk space (Recommended to use SSD hard disk type).

SEO NEO requirements depend on how you use the software.&#x20;

Factors that change your system requirements are:

* Running very big campaigns (more than 20 link groups/campaigns)
* Running multiple campaigns at the same time
* Thread settings of your campaigns (you can change how many threads are used for each campaign, in campaign creation form).
* Keeping a big number of old (finished) campaigns. This makes software database bigger and slower. This requires a fast SSD hard drive.
