# Create Account Bucket

Before creating your campaign, you must also create an account bucket. Account buckets work as folders that keep all generated accounts (from your campaigns).

You should have at least one account bucket to be used for your campaign.&#x20;

Account buckets are used to keep all generated accounts organized, so you are advised to give account buckets a name that you can later remember.

For more details on how to create an account bucket [**read this section**](../../../software-overview/account-buckets/creating-account-buckets.md).
