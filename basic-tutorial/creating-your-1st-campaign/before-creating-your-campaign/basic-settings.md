If you have subscription to 3rd party services like content creators (**Article Forge, OpenAI**) , spinners (**Spin Rewriter, Word AI, Spinner Chief, Espinner**) or any indexer service (**Omega Indexer, Colinkri, Speedlinks, Index Inject**) it is now the best time to set these settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
To improve your campaign results it is ultra-high recommended to also use an indexer service. Using an indexer doesn't effect how your campaigns run, but it effects how search engines favor your created backlinks from your campaigns.

It is recommended to use [**Omega Indexer**](https://www.omegaindexer.com/) or [**Colinkri**](https://www.colinkri.com/) crawler for your campaigns.
