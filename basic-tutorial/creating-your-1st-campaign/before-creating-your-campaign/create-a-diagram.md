# Create a diagram

Although you can use any included SEO NEO diagram, for this tutorial we will create a basic diagram to understand the basic concepts.

Lets create our diagram and name it "first tutorial".

Click "**Diagram Editor"** > Click "**Create**".

For diagram name type "first tutorial". and click "**Create**".

What we want for this tutorial is a diagram that includes a good number of rich content - high quality backlinks.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The most rich-content link group for SEO NEO (except from Cloud assets) is Web 2.0 Blogs. For every link group we will add into the diagram, SEO NEO will create blogs for sites like Wordpress.com, Tumblr, Weebly etc.
{% endhint %}

On the left side of Diagram Editor you can see all available link group types.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/diagram editor - link groups.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For this tutorial we want to create **3** x **Web 2.0 Blogs** link groups. To do so, click on "Web 2.0 Blogs" and **drag over** the empty diagram. Repeat this 2 more times.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/diagram editor - 3 web2 blogs.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can click and drag any group to move it. **Click and drag** all three created **Web 2.0 Blog** groups to align and fit them into the diagram.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/diagram editor - tutorial - move and align.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>You can click and drag any group to move it around the diagram</p></figcaption></figure>

Now it is time to create some connections between our link groups and money site. Connecting a group with money site means that this group will use "**Money Site URLs**" (user gives these URLs when creating the campaign) as links inside blog posts.

To connect a group with Moneysite or to another group, hover over any or 2 available group dots. When you hover with your mouse, you will notice that mouse cursor changes.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/diagram editor - tutorial - connection.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Hover over any of two white dots on any group to start creating a connection</p></figcaption></figure>

Then **click and drag** (and **hold down**) your mouse. As you move your mouse you will see a connection line. To create a connection with **Moneysite**, simple drag your mouse over **Moneysite** connection white dot.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/diagram editor - tutorial - connection 1.JPG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Repeat the same process for the rest of the groups to create connection for all three groups with **Moneysite**.

## Adding child groups

The diagram we have created has only 3 link groups connected to moneysite. Of course we can leave the diagram as it is, but for better SEO results, a diagram should have a more complex structure with more tiers (currently our diagram tier level is 1).

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/diagram - tutorial - tier 1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Combining different link group types, and using multiple tier levels result in a more "natural" link-building campaign, which means better SEO results.
{% endhint %}

To improve our diagram just a little bit, we will add some child groups under Web 2.0 Blogs. For this tutorial we will just add some URL Shorteners under each Web 2.0 Blogs groups.

When the campaign runs, links generated from one tier will be used into the other tier as targeted links.

Let's save the diagram&#x20;
