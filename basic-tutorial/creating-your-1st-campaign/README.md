# 1âƒ£ Creating your 1st campaign

In this tutorial we will see how we can create a simple campaign.&#x20;

Before creating your campaign it is recommended to write on a text file the URLs that you want your campaign to target (**Money Site URL Links**) and **keywords** that you want to use for your campaign.

Creating a campaign for the first time requires 6 main steps. After getting familiar with SEO NEO and setting some buckets, less steps may be required.

### Main steps to create your 1st campaign

1\) **Basic settings**: setup your proxies and any 3rd party API you want to use

2\) **Creating Content Bucket**: create a content bucket with content (articles, descriptions, bios, images and video URLs)&#x20;

3\) **Creating Account Bucket**: where all created accounts will get stored when you run your campaign.

4\) **Creating Account Template**: setting your account emails and account templates. You can omit this step if you use SEO NEO's default account template.

5\) **Creating a diagram**: You can omit this step if you use SEO NEO's pre-created diagrams.

6\) **Creating campaign**: in this step we will use created buckets, accounts and diagram from previous steps.
