# 1âƒ£ Creating your 1st campaign

In this tutorial we will see how we can create a simple campaign.&#x20;

Before creating your campaign it is recommended to write on a text file which URLs you want your campaign to target (**Money Site URL Links**) and **keywords** that you want to use for your campaign.

In order to create and run a campaign there are some prerequisites. Your campaign needs content ([**content buckets**](../../software-overview/content-buckets/)), accounts ([**account templates**](../../software-overview/account-templates/) and [**account buckets**](../../software-overview/account-buckets/)) and some [**third-party API services**](../../software-overview/settings/third-party-api.md) (captcha solving services, proxies etc).

So if this is the first time you create a campaign, this tutorial will guide you though all basic steps.

If you already have set all prerequisites then skip "Before creating your campaign" section and navigate to "[**Campaign creation**](campaign-creation.md)".
