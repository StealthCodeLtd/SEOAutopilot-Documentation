# Creating a diagram

Although you can use any included SEO NEO diagram, for this tutorial we will create a basic diagram to understand the basic concepts.

Lets create our diagram and name it "first tutorial".

Click "**Diagram Editor"** > Click "**Create**".

What we want for this tutorial is a diagram that includes a good number of rich content - high quality backlinks.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The most rich-content link group for SEO NEO (except from Cloud assets) is Web 2.0 Blogs. For every link group we will add into the diagram, SEO NEO will create blogs for sites like Wordpress.com, Tumblr, Weebly etc.
{% endhint %}

On the left side of Diagram Editor you can see all available link group types.&#x20;

For this tutorial we want to create **3** x **Web 2.0 Blogs** link groups. To do so, click on "Web 2.0 Blogs" and **drag over** the empty diagram. Repeat this 2 more times.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/diagram editor - 3 web2 blogs.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can click and drag any group to move it. **Click and drag** all three created **Web 2.0 Blog** groups to align and fit them into the diagram.

Now it is time to create some connections between our link groups and money site. Connecting a group with money site means that this group will use "**Money Site URLs**" (user gives these URLs when creating the campaign) as links inside blog posts.

To connect a group with Moneysite or to another group, hover over any or 2 available group dots. When you hover with your mouse, you will notice that mouse cursor changes.

Then **click and drag** (and **hold down**) your mouse. As you move your mouse you will see a connection line. To create a connection with **Moneysite**, simple drag your mouse over **Moneysite** connection white dot.

Repeat the same process for the rest of the groups to create connection for all three groups with **Moneysite**.
